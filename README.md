# PoliMi_ACTM
Group Project for Advanced Coding Tools and Methodologies 
by Bertan Kur≈üun, Gresia Baco , Luca Battisti



With this project, it is wanted to explore better solutions for classic drum machines which limit generating polyrhthmic and polymetric structures. In addition, research on gesture-controlled instruments with an accelerometer sensor attached to a hand glove is conducted, and different onset detection techniques are tested with MicroBit. 

1. run (index).html file on chrome (works only on chrome because of BLE pairing)
2. start clicking cells in the table to create pattern.
3. You can change the time measure from menu buttons.
4. press playback and stop to start/ stop loopers.
5. press reset if you want to change the time signature because it doesn't clear the memory of arrays even though the table is changed.

For Bluetooth connection: 
( MicroBit must be connected to battery firstly ) 
1. enable Bluetooth on computer and press "search device "
2. press "start reading"
3. you can learn the instruments individually with "learning modes"
4. "start kick and snare" / "start toms" / "start hats" buttons are starting to process of recording bars with hand gestures.
